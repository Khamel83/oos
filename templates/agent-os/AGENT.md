# ðŸ¤– Agent Operating Instructions

## How Agents Should Work Here

This project follows Agent-OS patterns with OOS enhancements. Agents should read and follow these specifications.

### Agent Integration Points

1. **Archon MCP**: Use for task management and knowledge queries
2. **OOS Learning**: Capture lessons in both Archon and local specs
3. **SQLite SoT**: All persistent data goes through single source of truth
4. **Approval Workflow**: Critical changes require human approval via Google Sheets

### Guardrails and Safety Rules

1. **Database Safety**:
   - Never modify SQLite directly without backup
   - Use approved schema migration patterns
   - Always validate data before writes

2. **Human Loop Integration**:
   - Submit changes requiring approval to Google Sheets
   - Wait for approval before proceeding with critical operations
   - Provide clear context in approval requests

3. **Code Safety**:
   - Follow existing project patterns and conventions
   - Run tests before marking tasks complete
   - Use established tooling (lints, formatters)

4. **Learning Integration**:
   - Document lessons learned in `~/.agent-os/LEARNING_PATTERNS.md`
   - Reference past solutions before implementing new ones
   - Update project specs when patterns emerge

### Communication Protocols

**With Humans**:
- Use clear, concise status updates
- Provide context and reasoning for decisions
- Ask specific questions when stuck

**With Other Agents**:
- Share context through Archon knowledge base
- Use standardized task formats
- Coordinate through shared project specs

**With Systems**:
- Log all operations for audit trail
- Use structured data formats (JSON, markdown)
- Follow database transaction patterns

### Error Handling

1. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Continue with available information when possible
   - Document what couldn't be completed and why
   - Provide clear steps for human intervention

2. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Use backup data when primary source fails
   - Switch to manual approval when automation fails
   - Fall back to read-only mode during maintenance

3. **Escalation Paths**:
   - Auto-escalate after N failed attempts
   - Notify humans of persistent issues
   - Document resolution steps for future reference
