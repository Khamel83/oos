# User Scenarios for: provision
# =============================
# Real-world user workflows for AI infrastructure provisioning

# Simple app deployment scenario
GIVEN user wants to deploy simple web app
WHEN user runs /provision "React blog with database"
THEN AI generates appropriate Docker Compose config
AND includes all necessary services
AND configuration is production-ready with SSL
AND user gets working app at subdomain

# Preview mode scenario
GIVEN user wants to see infrastructure before deploying
WHEN user runs /provision with --preview flag
THEN configuration is generated but not deployed
AND user can review all files before committing
AND deployment is safe and reversible

# Custom domain scenario
GIVEN user wants app on specific subdomain
WHEN user specifies custom domain in provision command
THEN infrastructure uses requested domain
AND SSL certificates are configured correctly
AND DNS routing works as expected

# Technology detection scenario
GIVEN user describes app in natural language
WHEN AI processes the description
THEN appropriate technology stack is selected
AND all necessary services are included
AND configuration matches user intent

# Error handling scenario
GIVEN user provides unclear or impossible requirements
WHEN provision command runs
THEN helpful error message explains the issue
AND user gets guidance on fixing the request
AND system doesn't crash or produce broken config

# Integration with existing setup scenario
GIVEN user has existing Oracle VM infrastructure
WHEN user provisions new app
THEN new app integrates with existing setup
AND doesn't conflict with running services
AND uses available resources efficiently

# Real-world complexity scenario
GIVEN user needs complex multi-service application
WHEN user describes full-stack requirements
THEN AI generates complete infrastructure
AND includes monitoring, logging, backups
AND configuration is genuinely production-ready
AND user gets enterprise-quality deployment
