# User Scenarios for: start-coding
# =================================
# Real-world user workflows for /start-coding command

# Basic workflow initiation scenario
GIVEN user wants to start a coding session
WHEN user runs /start-coding
THEN system displays current Archon tasks
AND user sees project context loaded
AND all integrations are verified working
AND user knows exactly what to work on next

# First-time user scenario
GIVEN user is new to OOS and doesn't know about /start-coding
WHEN user looks for help getting started
THEN /start-coding is prominently documented
AND help explains what it does clearly
AND examples show typical usage

# Archon connection failure scenario
GIVEN Archon MCP server is not running
WHEN user runs /start-coding
THEN clear error message explains Archon is unreachable
AND user gets instructions on how to fix it
AND system doesn't crash or hang
AND error is actionable, not technical jargon

# 1Password integration scenario
GIVEN user needs access to secrets during development
WHEN user runs /start-coding
THEN 1Password integration is checked automatically
AND user is prompted to sign in if needed
AND secrets are available for development
AND no manual credential hunting required

# Project context loading scenario
GIVEN user is working on multiple projects
WHEN user runs /start-coding in a specific project
THEN system loads context for THAT project
AND shows tasks relevant to current project
AND doesn't mix up tasks from other projects

# No current tasks scenario
GIVEN user has no active tasks in Archon
WHEN user runs /start-coding
THEN system gracefully handles empty task list
AND suggests creating new tasks
AND user isn't confused about what to do next

# Environment validation scenario
GIVEN user's development environment has issues
WHEN user runs /start-coding
THEN environment problems are detected
AND user gets specific fix instructions
AND development gate prevents broken work

# Task prioritization scenario
GIVEN user has multiple tasks available
WHEN user runs /start-coding
THEN tasks are shown in priority order
AND user can see which task to tackle first
