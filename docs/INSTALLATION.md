# ðŸš€ OOS Installation Guide

## One-Line Install (Recommended)

For the fastest setup, run this command in your terminal. It will automatically download OOS, and make it available everywhere on your system.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/oos/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

That's it! You can now use the `oos` command from any directory.

## What it Does

The script will:
1.  Clone the repository to `~/oos`.
2.  Create a system-wide `oos` command.
3.  Check for required tools like `python` and `git`.

## Next Steps

After installation, you can start using OOS immediately.

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Run OOS!
oos
```
