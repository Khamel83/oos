# Complete Workflow: Idea to Completion

**OOS Complete Workflow takes any project from idea to fully validated, documented, and deployed completion.**

## Usage

```bash
# Show workflow plan
./bin/complete-workflow.sh plan
/complete-workflow plan

# Interactive mode (recommended)
./bin/complete-workflow.sh interactive "My Project Idea"
/idea-to-done interactive "API Service"

# Automatic mode (minimal interaction)
./bin/complete-workflow.sh auto "React Blog App"
```

## The A→B→C→D→E→F→G→H Workflow

### A: Setup Development Environment (`/start-coding`)
- Validate development environment
- Setup Archon integration
- Configure 1Password access
- Load project context

### B: Development with RUAT
- Implement core functionality
- Create user scenarios with `/test-user-scenarios --create [feature]`
- Run user acceptance testing with `/ruat [feature]`
- Fix UX issues until scenarios pass

### C: Comprehensive Validation (`/validate`)
- Code-documentation alignment
- Functional testing
- Integration testing
- Simplicity analysis
- Generate validation report

### D: User Scenario Testing (`/ruat`)
- Validate ALL user scenarios
- Ensure UX excellence
- Fix any remaining UX issues
- Confirm user workflows work perfectly

### E: Pre-commit Validation (`/pre-commit`)
- Security checks
- Code quality validation
- Documentation checks

### F: Smart Commit (`/smart-commit`)
- Generate intelligent commit message
- Update Archon task status
- Create commit with full context

### G: Infrastructure Provisioning (`/provision`)
- Generate production configuration
- Deploy to infrastructure (Docker + Traefik)
- Configure SSL and monitoring
- Validate deployment

### H: Final Validation & Completion
- Verify all steps completed successfully
- Confirm deployment is working
- Mark project complete in Archon
- Generate completion summary

## Key Features

### Interactive Mode
- User confirmation at each step
- Ability to skip steps if needed
- Clear progress tracking
- Detailed error handling

### Automatic Mode
- Minimal interaction for CI/CD
- Assumes "yes" to all confirmations
- Continuous execution
- Ideal for automated workflows

### Plan Mode
- Shows complete workflow without execution
- Useful for understanding the process
- No changes made to system

## Integration

The complete workflow is automatically included when OOS is installed in any project via:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/oos/master/install.sh)
```

All validation and workflow tools are available as slash commands in Claude Code.

## Validation Philosophy

The workflow ensures **technical correctness AND user experience excellence**:

1. **Code Quality**: Comprehensive validation catches technical issues
2. **User Experience**: RUAT ensures features work how users actually use them
3. **Documentation**: Code-documentation alignment prevents drift
4. **Deployment**: Infrastructure provisioning ensures reliable hosting
5. **Completeness**: Every step is validated before proceeding

## Error Handling

If any step fails:
- Clear error message with suggested fix
- Workflow stops until issue resolved
- Can be resumed from any step
- Emergency bypass options available

This systematic approach prevents the common problem of "technically correct but terrible UX" features by requiring user acceptance testing before completion.
