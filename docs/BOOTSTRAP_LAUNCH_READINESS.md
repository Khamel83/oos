# Bootstrap Script Launch Readiness Checklist

## Philosophy Integration

Drawing from product launch best practices, our bootstrap script should be treated as a **product launch** with comprehensive validation, user testing, and monitoring.

## Pre-Launch Activities âœ…

### Core Feature Completeness
- [x] **Safe file creation** - No more silent overwrites
- [x] **Edge case handling** - Symlinks, directories, permissions
- [x] **User communication** - Clear warnings and guidance
- [x] **Backup functionality** - Automatic backups on overwrite
- [x] **Force flag implementation** - Explicit user control

### Beta Testing Framework
- [x] **Unit test suite** - `tests/test_bootstrap_safe_files.sh`
- [ ] **Integration testing** - Real environment validation
- [ ] **Regression testing** - Ensure existing functionality works
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Script execution time benchmarks

### Marketing Materials (Documentation)
- [x] **Product one-pager** - `docs/BOOTSTRAP_FILE_SAFETY.md`
- [x] **User guide** - Enhanced help text and examples
- [ ] **Migration guide** - For existing users
- [ ] **Best practices guide** - Recommended usage patterns

## Usability Test Plan

### Test Objectives
1. **Validate safety mechanisms** - Users don't lose data accidentally
2. **Confirm user understanding** - Clear warnings lead to correct actions
3. **Test edge case handling** - Script behaves predictably in unusual scenarios
4. **Measure user confidence** - Users feel safe running the script

### Participant Criteria
- **Experienced developers** - Familiar with bash scripts and development workflows
- **New users** - Haven't used the bootstrap script before
- **Power users** - Those who customize their development environments
- **Mixed skill levels** - Junior to senior developers

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: First-time User
**Goal**: User sets up new development environment
**Expected**: Script creates all files successfully
**Success Criteria**: All files created, no errors, user understands output

#### Scenario 2: Existing Environment
**Goal**: User runs script in directory with existing customizations
**Expected**: Script preserves existing files, shows clear warnings
**Success Criteria**: No data loss, user understands what was skipped

#### Scenario 3: Force Override
**Goal**: User intentionally wants to reset their configuration
**Expected**: Script overwrites with clear warnings about backups
**Success Criteria**: Files overwritten, backup created, user aware of changes

#### Scenario 4: Error Conditions
**Goal**: Test script behavior with permission issues, disk space, etc.
**Expected**: Graceful failure with helpful error messages
**Success Criteria**: No crashes, clear error communication, safe cleanup

### Test Tasks
1. **Task 1**: Run bootstrap in clean directory
2. **Task 2**: Run bootstrap again (should skip existing files)
3. **Task 3**: Use --force flag to overwrite
4. **Task 4**: Handle permission denied scenario
5. **Task 5**: Recover from interrupted execution

### Metrics for Success
- **Task completion rate**: >95% for basic scenarios
- **Error recovery rate**: >90% users can resolve issues with script guidance
- **User satisfaction**: >4.5/5 for confidence in script safety
- **Data loss incidents**: 0 reported cases

### Feedback Collection
- **Pre-test survey**: Current pain points and expectations
- **During-test observation**: Screen recordings, think-aloud protocol
- **Post-test interview**: Understanding of script behavior and confidence
- **Long-term follow-up**: Any issues discovered after real usage

## Technical Readiness

### Scalability Tests
- [ ] **Large file scenarios** - Test with many existing files
- [ ] **Network dependency handling** - 1Password, GitHub connectivity
- [ ] **Resource constraints** - Low disk space, memory limitations

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Execution time benchmarks** - Baseline performance metrics
- [ ] **Resource usage monitoring** - CPU, memory, disk I/O
- [ ] **Optimization opportunities** - Parallel operations, caching

### Bug Fixes
- [x] **Critical**: Silent file overwrite (FIXED)
- [ ] **High**: 1Password dependency validation
- [ ] **Medium**: Error message clarity improvements
- [ ] **Low**: Progress indicator accuracy

## Sales Enablement (User Adoption)

### Demo Materials
- [ ] **Video walkthrough** - Common usage scenarios
- [ ] **Interactive demo** - Safe testing environment
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions

### Training Materials
- [ ] **Quick start guide** - 5-minute setup for new users
- [ ] **Advanced usage** - Power user features and customization
- [ ] **Migration guide** - For users of old bootstrap versions

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### User Feedback Tracking
- [ ] **Issue reporting system** - GitHub issues with templates
- [ ] **Usage analytics** - How often scripts are run, common flags used
- [ ] **Error telemetry** - Anonymous error reporting (opt-in)

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Adoption rate**: New users per week/month
- **Error rate**: Failed executions per total runs
- **User retention**: Repeat usage patterns
- **Support burden**: Support tickets related to bootstrap issues

### Rollout Updates
- [ ] **Hotfix process** - Rapid deployment of critical fixes
- [ ] **Feature rollout** - Gradual introduction of new features
- [ ] **Deprecation strategy** - Retiring old patterns safely

## Analysis & Recommendations

### Success Indicators
1. **Zero data loss reports** - No users lose work due to script behavior
2. **High user confidence** - Users feel safe running the script repeatedly
3. **Clear mental models** - Users understand what the script will do
4. **Graceful failure** - Problems are communicated clearly with recovery guidance

### Continuous Improvement Process
1. **Weekly monitoring** - Review error rates and user feedback
2. **Monthly retrospectives** - Analyze patterns and improvement opportunities
3. **Quarterly roadmap** - Plan major enhancements based on user needs
4. **Annual architecture review** - Assess if fundamental approach still serves users
