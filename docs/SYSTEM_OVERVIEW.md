# OOS System Overview - What Everything Actually Does

This document explains exactly what OOS is, what each component does, and how everything fits together.

## üéØ The Big Picture

**OOS = Project Bootstrap + Management Tools**

Think of it like this:
- **Core Function**: "I want to start a new project with AI tools properly configured"
- **Extended Function**: "I want to monitor, test, and maintain my development environment"

## üì¶ What You Actually Have

### **Level 1: Core OOS (Your Original System)**
```
scripts/bootstrap.sh                    # "Set up a new project"
.agents/runners/run_claude.sh   # "Run Claude with proper environment"
bin/safe_source_env.sh         # "Load secrets from 1Password safely"
```

**This is the essential OOS.** Everything else is optional.

### **Level 2: Enhanced Management (What We Added)**
```
scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh           # "Bootstrap with pre-flight checks"
bin/diagnose.sh                # "Fix problems automatically"
bin/health_monitor.sh          # "Watch everything continuously"
bin/run_tests.sh              # "Ensure everything works"
bin/security_audit.sh         # "Check for security issues"
bin/performance_monitor.sh    # "Profile and optimize"
bin/template_manager.sh       # "Create projects from templates"
bin/key_rotator.sh            # "Manage API keys automatically"
```

**These are power tools for serious development.**

### **Level 3: External Integrations (Optional)**
```
Archon MCP Server              # External task management service
Dashboard (dashboard/)         # Web interface for monitoring
```

**You can ignore these entirely if you want.**

## ü§î Common Confusions Explained

### **"Is Archon part of OOS?"**
**NO.** Archon is a separate service that OOS can optionally talk to.

- **Archon**: External task management server (like Jira, but simpler)
- **OOS**: Project bootstrap and management tools
- **They can work together, but OOS works fine without Archon**

### **"What does atlas.db have to do with anything?"**
**NOTHING.** It's from your Atlas project and got mixed in by accident. It's not part of OOS.

### **"Do I need all these bin/ scripts?"**
**NO.** Start with just:
- `scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh` (or original `scripts/bootstrap.sh`)
- `bin/diagnose.sh` (when things break)

Use the others as needed.

## üöÄ How to Actually Use This

### **Scenario 1: Simple Project Setup**
```bash
# Just want to start a new project
./scripts/scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh my-new-project /path/to/my-new-project

# That's it. You're done.
```

### **Scenario 2: Professional Development**
```bash
# Set up project with monitoring
./scripts/scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh my-project /path/to/project
./bin/health_monitor.sh daemon    # Start monitoring
./bin/run_tests.sh all            # Ensure everything works
```

### **Scenario 3: Enterprise/Team Use**
```bash
# Full professional setup
./scripts/scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh --security-hardened my-project /path/to/project
./bin/security_audit.sh scan --fix
./bin/performance_monitor.sh benchmark
cd dashboard && python3 api/server.py  # Web dashboard
```

## üîç What Each Tool Actually Does

### **Bootstrap Scripts**
- **`scripts/bootstrap.sh`**: Original simple setup
- **`scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh`**: Setup with validation, rollback, and error handling

### **Management Tools**
- **`diagnose.sh`**: "Something's broken, fix it automatically"
- **`health_monitor.sh`**: "Tell me if anything stops working"
- **`run_tests.sh`**: "Verify everything still works"
- **`security_audit.sh`**: "Check for security problems"

### **Development Tools**
- **`performance_monitor.sh`**: "Profile scripts and find bottlenecks"
- **`template_manager.sh`**: "Create new projects from templates"
- **`key_rotator.sh`**: "Manage API keys automatically"

### **Integration Tools**
- **`mcp_manager.sh`**: "Manage connections to external services like Archon"
- **`dashboard/`**: "Web interface to see everything"

## üéØ Decision Tree: What Do I Actually Need?

```
Do you just want to bootstrap projects?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES: Use scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh, ignore everything else
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO: Continue...

Do you want monitoring and diagnostics?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES: Add bin/diagnose.sh and bin/health_monitor.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO: Continue...

Do you work on teams or need security compliance?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES: Add bin/security_audit.sh and bin/run_tests.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO: Continue...

Do you want task management integration?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES: Set up Archon MCP server separately, use bin/mcp_manager.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO: You're done!
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Minimal OOS Setup

If you're overwhelmed, start with just this:

```bash
# 1. Copy these files to a new project directory:
scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh           # Project setup
bin/diagnose.sh                # Problem fixing
bin/safe_source_env.sh         # Environment handling
.agents/runners/run_claude.sh  # Claude CLI runner

# 2. Run setup:
./scripts/scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh

# 3. When things break:
./bin/diagnose.sh --self-heal

# That's it. Everything else is optional.
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I need the dashboard?**
A: Only if you want a web interface. The command line tools do everything.

**Q: What's the difference between scripts/bootstrap.sh and scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh?**
A: Enhanced version has error checking, rollback, and validation. Use it.

**Q: Can I use this without Archon?**
A: Yes! OOS works completely independently. Archon is optional task management.

**Q: Why are there so many scripts in bin/?**
A: Each solves a specific problem. Use what you need, ignore the rest.

**Q: Is this overkill for personal projects?**
A: Yes, probably. Use just scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh and bin/diagnose.sh.

**Q: Can I remove files I don't need?**
A: Absolutely. OOS is modular - delete anything you don't use.

## üéØ Summary

**OOS Core Purpose**: Bootstrap projects with proper AI tool setup and secret management.

**Everything Else**: Optional power tools for professional development environments.

**Start Simple**: Use `scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh`, add tools as needed.

**Ignore Complexity**: Most features are optional. The core system is just project setup.
