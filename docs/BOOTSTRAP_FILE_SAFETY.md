# Bootstrap File Safety Fix

## Problem Fixed

The `scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh` script was **silently overwriting existing user files** without warning or backup, causing potential data loss. This violated basic UX principles and could destroy user customizations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Safe File Creation Function

Added `create_file_safely()` function that:
- **Checks for existing files** before creating new ones
- **Preserves existing content** by default
- **Only overwrites with explicit `--force` flag**
- **Handles edge cases**: symlinks, directories, permission errors
- **Provides clear user feedback** about what's happening

### 2. Enhanced User Communication

**Help Text Updates:**
```bash
File Safety:
  By default, existing files are preserved (not overwritten).
  Use --force to overwrite existing files. Backups are automatically created.
  Check for warnings about skipped files during normal runs.
```

**Improved Warning Messages:**
- Clear indication when files are skipped
- Guidance on how to override (`--force`)
- Information about automatic backups
- Specific handling for symlinks and directories

### 3. Edge Case Handling

**Directory Conflicts:**
```bash
error "Cannot create file: path is a directory"
```

**Symlink Handling:**
```bash
warn "Skipping existing symlink: path"
warn "  → Use --force to overwrite (will replace symlink with regular file)"
```

**Permission Errors:**
```bash
error "Cannot write file: path (permission denied?)"
```

## Files Affected

The following files are now created safely:
- `dev.md` - Development log
- `.agents/agents.md` - Agent instructions
- `.claude/commands/plan.md` - Claude command templates
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code overlay
- `docs/GEMINI.md` - Gemini CLI overlay
- `docs/qwen.md` - Qwen Code overlay

## Usage Examples

### Normal Run (Preserves Existing Files)
```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh
# Output: [WARN] Skipping existing file: docs/CLAUDE.md
#         [WARN]   → Use --force to overwrite (automatic backup will be created)
```

### Force Overwrite (With Backup)
```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh --force
# Output: [WARN] Overwriting existing file: docs/CLAUDE.md (backup created)
```

### Check What Would Happen
```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh --dry-run --verbose
# Shows all operations without making changes
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Created `tests/test_bootstrap_safe_files.sh` that tests:

1. **New file creation** - Should work normally
2. **Existing file skip** - Should preserve without `--force`
3. **Force overwrite** - Should overwrite with `--force`
4. **Permission errors** - Should fail gracefully
5. **Directory conflicts** - Should handle correctly
6. **Symlink handling** - Should preserve or replace appropriately
7. **Backup functionality** - Should create backups when overwriting

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run bootstrap on clean directory (should create files)
- [ ] Run bootstrap again (should skip existing files)
- [ ] Run bootstrap with `--force` (should overwrite with warnings)
- [ ] Test with existing directory named like target file
- [ ] Test with symlinks in target locations
- [ ] Verify backup creation works
- [ ] Test permission denied scenarios

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ❌ Silent file overwrites
- ❌ No user awareness of data loss
- ❌ No backup or recovery options
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After Fix
- ✅ Explicit user consent required for overwrites
- ✅ Automatic backups when overwriting
- ✅ Clear communication about file operations
- ✅ Graceful handling of edge cases
- ✅ Preserved user customizations by default

## Rollout Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test thoroughly** in development environments
2. **Update documentation** to explain new behavior
3. **Communicate changes** to all script users

### User Communication
```
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Bootstrap script now preserves existing files by default.
   - Existing files will be skipped (not overwritten)
   - Use --force flag to overwrite (creates backups)
   - Check warnings for skipped files during normal runs
```

### CI/CD Considerations
If automated systems use this script:
- Review for `--force` flag usage
- Ensure automation can handle "file skipped" scenarios
- Update any pipelines that depend on file overwrite behavior

## Future Improvements

1. **Interactive mode**: Prompt user per file for overwrite decisions
2. **Diff preview**: Show differences before overwriting
3. **Selective overwrite**: Choose which files to overwrite
4. **Restore command**: Easy restoration from backups
5. **Config file**: Persistent user preferences for file handling

## Validation

The fix ensures:
- ✅ No data loss from unexpected overwrites
- ✅ User agency in file management decisions  
- ✅ Clear communication of all file operations
- ✅ Robust handling of filesystem edge cases
- ✅ Backward compatibility with `--force` flag
