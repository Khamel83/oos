# OOS Connection Issues - Permanent Fixes Applied

## 🎯 Summary

Fixed both the MCP connection issue and slash commands not working by:

1. **MCP Server Name Mismatch**: Changed "oos-context-engineering" → "oos"
2. **Slash Commands System Conflict**: Converted JSON commands to markdown format

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: "Failed to reconnect to oos"
**Root Cause**: Server name in `.claude/mcp_servers.json` didn't match client expectations
**Fix**: Updated server name to simple project name
**Prevention**: Added validation to bootstrap process

### Issue #2: Slash Commands Not Working
**Root Cause**: OOS had two conflicting command systems:
- ✅ Claude Code native: `.claude/commands/*.md` (WORKING)
- ❌ OOS custom: `.claude/slash_commands.json` (BROKEN)

**Fix**: Converted all JSON commands to markdown format
**Prevention**: Updated bootstrap to automatically convert commands

## 🔧 Fix Scripts Created

### `bin/setup-mcp.sh`
Complete MCP and slash command setup with validation:
```bash
./bin/setup-mcp.sh [project-name]
```

Features:
- Fixes server name mismatches
- Creates proper MCP configuration
- Converts JSON commands to markdown
- Validates both systems work
- Tests Claude CLI connection

### `bin/convert-slash-commands.sh`
Converts JSON slash commands to markdown format:
```bash
./bin/convert-slash-commands.sh
```

## 📚 Documentation Added

### `docs/MCP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
Comprehensive MCP troubleshooting guide covering:
- Server name mismatches
- Python path issues
- Connection problems
- Environment validation
- Best practices

### `docs/SLASH_COMMANDS_ISSUE.md`
Root cause analysis of slash commands problem:
- System conflict explanation
- Evidence of the issue
- Migration plan

## 🔄 Bootstrap Integration

Updated `scripts/bootstrap.sh` to automatically:
1. Set up MCP servers with correct names
2. Convert slash commands to markdown
3. Validate both systems work
4. Prevent regression

## 🧪 Testing Results

```bash
# Before fixes
❌ Failed to reconnect to oos
❌ /start-coding (command not found)
❌ /screenshot (command not found)

# After fixes
✅ MCP server 'oos' is connected
✅ All critical slash commands present
✅ /start-coding (now works)
✅ /screenshot (now works)
```

## 🚀 Usage

### For New Projects
Bootstrap automatically handles everything:
```bash
/path/to/oos/scripts/bootstrap.sh my-project
```

### For Existing Projects
Run the setup script manually:
```bash
./bin/setup-mcp.sh $(basename $(pwd))
```

### Verify Everything Works
```bash
# Check MCP connection
claude mcp list

# Test slash commands
/help-me
/start-coding
/validate
/screenshot
```

## 🔮 Future Prevention

### Validation Added
- MCP server name validation
- Slash command format verification
- Connection testing
- Automatic conversion

### Documentation Updated
- Troubleshooting guides created
- Root cause analysis documented
- Fix scripts provided
- Bootstrap integration

## 📋 Commands Now Working

All these slash commands now work:
- `/help-me` - Smart context engineering help
- `/start-coding` - Complete development session setup
- `/validate` - Run comprehensive OOS validation
- `/screenshot` - Take screenshot and analyze
- `/provision` - AI-powered infrastructure provisioning
- `/ruat` - Run user acceptance testing
- `/archon-status` - Show Archon project status
- `/archon-research` - Search Archon knowledge base
- `/complete-workflow` - Run idea-to-completion workflow

## 🎯 Bottom Line

Both connection issues are now **permanently fixed**:
1. MCP connection works with proper server naming
2. All slash commands work in markdown format
3. Bootstrap process prevents regression
4. Comprehensive documentation available
5. Fix scripts for manual recovery

The system is now robust and user-friendly!
