# üìö Documentation Reorganization Complete

**What I did to make OOS documentation not suck for forgetful users.**

---

## üéØ The Problem I Solved

**Before:**
- 60+ scattered documentation files with no clear organization
- Technical docs mixed with beginner guides
- No clear path from "what is this" to "how do I use it"
- Overwhelming for users who are "dumb and forgetful"
- Task system docs were comprehensive but buried

**After:**
- Clear documentation hierarchy from beginner to advanced
- Simple, step-by-step guides for forgetful users
- Emergency documentation for when your brain resets
- Task system mastery path from basics to expert
- One-page cheat sheets for quick reference

## üí° Key Insight

**The core insight:** Forgetful users don't need more documentation - they need *better organized* documentation with clear paths for different mental states:

- **First-time user:** Needs the absolute basics
- **Returning user:** Needs memory jogger
- **Active user:** Needs quick reference
- **Struggling user:** Needs troubleshooting
- **Power user:** Needs advanced features

**Everything is now organized around these mental states, not around technical features.**

*Documentation is now organized for how humans actually use software, not how engineers think about it.*
