# OOS Constitution

This document outlines the core principles for development on the OOS project, with a focus on effective AI-agent collaboration.

## Core Principles

### I. Ideal Task Definition

All tasks must be defined with the highest possible clarity to ensure effective and autonomous execution by an AI agent. This includes:
- **Atomicity**: Tasks must be broken down into the smallest possible logical unit of work.
- **Explicitness**: Instructions must be unambiguous, leaving no room for interpretation.
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Every task must have a verifiable definition of "done", such as performance benchmarks or specific component behavior.
- **Reference Existing Patterns**: New code should explicitly reference existing files or patterns that it must follow.

### II. Ideal Project Environment

The project environment must be fully automated and reproducible to eliminate ambiguity for any developer or agent.
- **Automated Setup**: The project must have a script (`bootstrap_enhanced.sh`) that installs all required dependencies, tools, and runtimes.
- **Configuration Management**: All configuration, especially secrets, must be loaded from environment variables (`.env` file), which is managed by the OOS tool itself.
- **A Comprehensive `README.md`**: The README must serve as the primary entry point for developers, containing clear, step-by-step instructions for setup, testing, and linting.

### III. Ideal Codebase

The quality and structure of the codebase are paramount for enabling reliable and rapid changes.
- **A Strong Test Suite (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: A comprehensive test suite (unit, integration) is the most critical factor for success. All new features must include tests. TDD (Test-Driven Development) is the required workflow.
- **Consistent Code Style**: A linter (`Ruff`) and code formatter (`Black`) are configured and must be used to maintain a predictable and readable codebase.
- **Modularity**: The codebase should strive for a clear separation of concerns, allowing agents to work on one component without needing to understand the entire system.

## Governance

- This Constitution supersedes all other practices. All development work, whether by a human or an AI agent, must adhere to these principles.
- All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution.
- Any amendments to this constitution require documentation, team approval, and a clear migration plan.
