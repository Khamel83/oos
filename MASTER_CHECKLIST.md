# ðŸŽ¯ OOS Master Testing Checklist

**Iterative testing until everything is ironed out**

---

## ðŸ”¥ **CHECKLIST 1: CRITICAL USER EXPERIENCE**

### Command Intuition & Learning
- [ ] Can someone understand what each command does without reading docs?
- [ ] Are command names as simple as possible? (Could any be shorter/simpler?)
- [ ] Is `/help` genuinely helpful for a confused user?
- [ ] What happens when you run a command with no arguments? Clear guidance?
- [ ] Error messages - are they helpful or technical jargon?

### First-Time User Journey
- [ ] Install â†’ First command â†’ Successful workflow - does it feel magical?
- [ ] Total time from "never heard of OOS" to "productive use" - how long?
- [ ] Moment of confusion - when/if it happens, how does user recover?
- [ ] Documentation - is it discoverable when needed?

---

## ðŸ”¥ **CHECKLIST 2: TECHNICAL ROBUSTNESS**

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] What happens when internet connection drops during install?
- [ ] Invalid arguments - graceful error messages?
- [ ] Missing dependencies (Python, git, uv) - helpful installation instructions?
- [ ] Permission denied errors - clear fix instructions?
- [ ] Disk space full - graceful handling?

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- [ ] macOS compatibility (Intel/Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Linux compatibility (Ubuntu, other distros)
- [ ] Windows compatibility (WSL, native)
- [ ] Different shell environments (bash, zsh, fish)

### Performance & Resources
- [ ] Command execution time - under 2 seconds for common operations?
- [ ] Memory usage - reasonable for development machines?
- [ ] Disk usage - not bloating projects unnecessarily?
- [ ] Network usage - minimal and efficient?

## ðŸ”¥ **CHECKLIST 3: INTEGRATION & ECOSYSTEM**

### Tool Compatibility
- [ ] VS Code integration - works seamlessly?
- [ ] Git integration - doesn't interfere with normal git workflow?
- [ ] GitHub integration - works with repositories, PRs, issues?
- [ ] Existing project structures - doesn't break them?
- [ ] Team collaboration - can multiple developers use OOS together?

### Workflow Integration
- [ ] Existing development workflows - can OOS enhance them?
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines - can OOS commands be used in automation?
- [ ] Docker/container environments - works correctly?
- [ ] IDE integration beyond VS Code?

---

## ðŸ”¥ **CHECKLIST 4: INSTALLATION & ONBOARDING**

### Installation Robustness
- [ ] One-line installer - truly works everywhere?
- [ ] Corporate environments - handles proxies, firewalls?
- [ ] Installation failures - rollback and recovery?
- [ ] Updates - seamless, non-breaking?
- [ ] Uninstallation - clean removal if needed?

### First Experience
- [ ] Installation success feedback - clear and encouraging?
- [ ] Immediate next steps - obvious what to do first?
- [ ] Sample project or tutorial - easy to try?
- [ ] Success moment - when does user feel "this is working"?

---

## ðŸ”¥ **CHECKLIST 5: DOCUMENTATION & HELP**

### Help System Quality
- [ ] `/help` command - genuinely useful or just lists commands?
- [ ] Command-specific help - detailed examples?
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide - covers common issues?
- [ ] Examples - real-world use cases?
- [ ] Searchability - easy to find what you need?

### Learning Resources
- [ ] Getting started tutorial - complete beginner can follow?
- [ ] Video content - visual learners supported?
- [ ] Advanced features - documented for power users?
- [ ] FAQ - covers common questions?

---

## ðŸ”¥ **CHECKLIST 6: SECURITY & PRIVACY**

### Data & Privacy
- [ ] What data is collected/stored - transparent to users?
- [ ] Sensitive data handling - passwords, API keys, tokens?
- [ ] Log files - no sensitive information leaked?
- [ ] Network requests - all necessary and secure?
- [ ] Code execution safety - prevents malicious commands?

### 1Password Integration
- [ ] Secure storage of credentials?
- [ ] No exposure of secrets in logs or processes?
- [ ] Proper session management?
- [ ] Revocation handling when compromised?

---

## ðŸ”¥ **CHECKLIST 7: REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS**

### User Personas
- [ ] Complete beginner - can they become productive?
- [ ] Experienced developer - does it enhance their workflow?
- [ ] Team lead - can they manage projects with OOS?
- [ ] DevOps engineer - can they use OOS in automation?
- [ ] Student/learner - is it educational and supportive?

### Project Types
- [ ] Simple scripts/tools - OOS helps or overkill?
- [ ] Web applications - integrates well?
- [ ] Data science projects - supports the workflow?
- [ ] System tools - appropriate for the domain?
- [ ] Open source projects - good for collaboration?

### Emergency Scenarios
- [ ] Production issue - can OOS help quickly?
- [ ] Broken environment - can OOS diagnose/fix?
- [ ] Time pressure - does OOS speed things up or slow down?
- [ ] Complex debugging - OOS provides clarity or confusion?
