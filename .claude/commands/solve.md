# /solve

Quick problem-solving workflow with systematic debugging and Archon knowledge.

Perfect for when something isn't working and you need a structured approach to fix it.

## Usage

```bash
./bin/agentic-daily.sh solve "$ARGUMENTS"
```

## Examples

```bash
/solve "my tests are failing with import errors"
/solve "authentication keeps timing out"
/solve "Docker container won't start"
/solve "deployment pipeline is broken"
```

## Systematic Problem-Solving Process

1. **Define Problem** - Clear problem statement
2. **Research Solutions** - Check Archon for similar issues
3. **Apply Systematic Debugging** - OOS debugging patterns
4. **Validate Solution** - RUAT testing
5. **Capture Pattern** - Save solution to Archon

## Integration

- **Archon Research** - Finds similar problems and solutions
- **OOS Patterns** - Applies systematic debugging methodology
- **Learning Capture** - Saves successful solutions for future reference

Use this whenever you're stuck and need structured problem-solving guidance.
