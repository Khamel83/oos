# Claude Code Overlay - OOS Development Guidelines

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL: Read OOS Guidelines First
- **Read [docs/TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md)** - Apply these learnings to ALL development
- **Read [docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)** - Understand the architecture before changing it
- **Read .agents/agents.md** - General development practices

## ðŸ§  Development Philosophy for OOS
1. **Simple over Complex**: If it's hard to understand, it's probably wrong
2. **Self-Documenting**: Every tool should explain what it does and why
3. **Modular Design**: Users should be able to use just what they need
4. **Test-Driven**: If you can't test it automatically, reconsider the approach
5. **User-Centric**: Ask "will users understand this?" before adding features
