# OOS - Organized Operational Setup

## CRITICAL: Archon Integration

**READ `docs/ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md` FIRST BEFORE RESPONDING TO ANY REQUEST**

This project REQUIRES explicit use of Archon tools. Do not proceed without understanding Archon integration.

Key rules:
1. Search Archon before answering documentation questions
2. Check Archon tasks before suggesting work
3. Update Archon tasks when work is completed

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL: Read OOS Guidelines First
- **Read [docs/TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md)** - Apply these learnings to ALL development
- **Read [docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)** - Understand the architecture before changing it
- **Read .agents/agents.md** - General development practices

## ðŸ§  Development Philosophy for OOS
1. **Simple over Complex**: If it's hard to understand, it's probably wrong
2. **Self-Documenting**: Every tool should explain what it does and why
3. **Modular Design**: Users should be able to use just what they need
4. **Test-Driven**: If you can't test it automatically, reconsider the approach
5. **User-Centric**: Ask "will users understand this?" before adding features
