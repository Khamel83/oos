# OOS (Organized Operational Setup)

**Your systematic thinking environment** - a brain extension system for consistent, structured development workflows.

OOS transforms how you approach any coding work, project, or idea by providing a unified environment that connects:
- **Consistent Platform** - Reliable development environment everywhere
- **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management
- **Agentic Thinking** - Future-ready for AI-powered workflows

## Install

Run this in **any project directory** (new or existing):

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/oos/master/install.sh)
```

**Then restart Claude Code** to activate all slash commands.

## Use

```bash
/start-coding          # Start systematic development session
/modules list          # See available thinking tools
/dev-setup             # Validate your brain environment
/pre-commit            # Run systematic checks before committing
/help-me               # Smart context engineering help
/optimize              # Optimize current context for token efficiency
/auto-fix              # Automatically fix code consistency issues
/smart-commit          # Generate intelligent commit messages
```

## What You Get

**Your Systematic Brain Environment:**
- **Consistent Mental Models** - Same thinking approach for every project
- **20+ slash commands** - Complete systematic workflow integration in Claude Code
- **Project Management Layer** - Archon integration for structured work tracking
- **Quality Assurance** - Automated validation that supports your thinking
- **Bootstrap System** - Instantly create consistent thinking environments
- **Future-Ready Architecture** - Built for agentic thinking and AI collaboration

### ðŸ§  How It Works as Your Brain Extension:

1. **Consistent Platform** - Same development environment, same mental models, everywhere
2. **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management that coordinates with your thinking
3. **Agentic Thinking Ready** - Future-proofed for AI-powered systematic workflows

| `/start-coding` | Start systematic development session |
| `/modules [name]` | Run security/python/git modules |
| `/dev-setup` | Complete development environment validation |
| `/pre-commit` | Pre-commit validation workflow |
| `/update-oos` | Update your brain tools |
| `/create-project [template]` | Create new systematic project |

**AI-Powered Workflow:**
| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/help-me` | Smart context engineering help |
| `/optimize` | Optimize current context for token efficiency |
| `/auto-fix` | Automatically fix code consistency issues |
| `/smart-commit` | Generate intelligent commit messages |
| `/brain-dump` | Smart processing of rambling input |
| `/clarify` | Start clarification workflow |

## 1Password Integration

OOS includes automatic 1Password service account setup for long-term authentication:

```bash
# Set up service account (works for weeks/months)
./bin/setup-1password-service.sh

# Test existing setup
./bin/setup-1password-service.sh --test

# Reset and reconfigure
./bin/setup-1password-service.sh --reset
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Long-term authentication (weeks/months)
- âœ… Works across all OOS installations automatically
- âœ… No manual signin required
- âœ… Integrated with `/start-coding` and development gate
