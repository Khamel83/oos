# OOS (Organized Operational Setup)

**Your systematic thinking environment** - a brain extension system for consistent, structured development workflows.

OOS transforms how you approach any coding work, project, or idea by providing a unified environment that connects:
- **Consistent Platform** - Reliable development environment everywhere
- **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management
- **Agentic Thinking** - Future-ready for AI-powered workflows

## Install

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/oos/master/install.sh)
```

## Use

```bash
/start-coding          # Start systematic development session
/modules list          # See available thinking tools
/dev-setup             # Validate your brain environment
/pre-commit            # Run systematic checks before committing
```

## What You Get

**Your Systematic Brain Environment:**
- **Consistent Mental Models** - Same thinking approach for every project
- **6+ slash commands** - Integrate your systematic workflow into Claude Code
- **Project Management Layer** - Archon integration for structured work tracking
- **Quality Assurance** - Automated validation that supports your thinking
- **Bootstrap System** - Instantly create consistent thinking environments
- **Future-Ready Architecture** - Built for agentic thinking and AI collaboration

### ðŸ§  How It Works as Your Brain Extension:

1. **Consistent Platform** - Same development environment, same mental models, everywhere
2. **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management that coordinates with your thinking
3. **Agentic Thinking Ready** - Future-proofed for AI-powered systematic workflows
