# OOS (Organized Operational Setup)

**Your systematic thinking environment** - a brain extension system for consistent, structured development workflows.

OOS transforms how you approach any coding work, project, or idea by providing a unified environment that connects:
- **Consistent Platform** - Reliable development environment everywhere
- **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management
- **Agentic Thinking** - Future-ready for AI-powered workflows

## Install - Universal Solution

**Works for both NEW and EXISTING projects** - one command fits all:

```bash
# NEW PROJECT: Create and setup in one step
cd ~/Documents  # or anywhere you want projects
oos create my-new-project

# EXISTING PROJECT: Add OOS to any current project
cd ~/path/to/existing/project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/oos/master/install.sh | bash
```

**That's it. OOS is now ready.** üéØ

**Next steps (after restarting Claude Code):**
```bash
/dev check             # Validate and refresh commands automatically
/workflow complete     # See the systematic A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíD workflow
```

### ‚úÖ Update Compatibility
**OOS updates work seamlessly from any older version:**
```bash
# From any OOS installation, run:
/project update        # Auto-updates while preserving your work
```

**Guaranteed compatibility** - updates never break existing projects or configurations.

## What You Get

**Your Systematic Brain Environment:**
- **Consistent Mental Models** - Same thinking approach for every project
- **11 perfect slash commands** - Complete systematic workflow integration in Claude Code
- **Auto-Refresh System** - Commands stay current and validate themselves automatically
- **Project Management Layer** - Archon integration for structured work tracking
- **Quality Assurance** - Automated validation that supports your thinking
- **Bootstrap System** - Instantly create consistent thinking environments
- **Future-Ready Architecture** - Built for agentic thinking and AI collaboration

### üîÑ Auto-Refresh & Validation

OOS automatically maintains itself:

- **Startup Health Check** - `/startup-check` runs automatically to validate commands
- **Version Tracking** - Detects when OOS updates and refreshes commands
- **Rollback Protection** - Automatic backup and restore if updates fail
- **Validation Testing** - Every command is tested for functionality
- **Fuckup Detection** - Issues are caught and reported immediately

This ensures your slash commands always work or you get clear error messages about what's wrong.

### üß† How It Works as Your Brain Extension:

1. **Consistent Platform** - Same development environment, same mental models, everywhere
2. **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management that coordinates with your thinking
3. **Agentic Thinking Ready** - Future-proofed for AI-powered systematic workflows
