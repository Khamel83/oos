# OOS (Organized Operational Setup)

**Your systematic thinking environment** - a brain extension system for consistent, structured development workflows.

OOS transforms how you approach any coding work, project, or idea by providing a unified environment that connects:
- **Consistent Platform** - Reliable development environment everywhere
- **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management
- **Agentic Thinking** - Future-ready for AI-powered workflows

## Install

Run this in **any project directory** (new or existing):

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/oos/master/install.sh)
```

**Then restart Claude Code** to activate all slash commands.

**After restarting, run:**
```bash
/startup-check         # Validate and refresh commands automatically
/complete-workflow plan # See the systematic Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’D workflow
```

## Use

```bash
/start-coding          # Start systematic development session
/complete-workflow     # Complete idea-to-completion workflow Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’D
/idea-to-done          # Alias for complete workflow
/validate              # Run comprehensive OOS validation
/ruat                  # Recursive User-Acceptance Testing
/provision             # AI-powered infrastructure provisioning
/screenshot            # Take screenshot and analyze with Claude
/oos-refresh           # Auto-refresh slash commands and validate
/startup-check         # Startup health check (run automatically)
/help-me               # Smart context engineering help
/pre-commit            # Run systematic checks before committing
/smart-commit          # Generate intelligent commit messages
```

## What You Get

**Your Systematic Brain Environment:**
- **Consistent Mental Models** - Same thinking approach for every project
- **20+ slash commands** - Complete systematic workflow integration in Claude Code
- **Auto-Refresh System** - Commands stay current and validate themselves automatically
- **Project Management Layer** - Archon integration for structured work tracking
- **Quality Assurance** - Automated validation that supports your thinking
- **Bootstrap System** - Instantly create consistent thinking environments
- **Future-Ready Architecture** - Built for agentic thinking and AI collaboration

### ðŸ”„ Auto-Refresh & Validation

OOS automatically maintains itself:

- **Startup Health Check** - `/startup-check` runs automatically to validate commands
- **Version Tracking** - Detects when OOS updates and refreshes commands
- **Rollback Protection** - Automatic backup and restore if updates fail
- **Validation Testing** - Every command is tested for functionality
- **Fuckup Detection** - Issues are caught and reported immediately

This ensures your slash commands always work or you get clear error messages about what's wrong.

### ðŸ§  How It Works as Your Brain Extension:

1. **Consistent Platform** - Same development environment, same mental models, everywhere
2. **Archon Integration** - Systematic project management that coordinates with your thinking
3. **Agentic Thinking Ready** - Future-proofed for AI-powered systematic workflows

## Integrations

OOS includes automatic setup for development tools:

### Python Development Environment
Complete agentic Python development setup with modern tooling:

**Package Management:**
- **uv** - Unified Python package manager for fast, reliable dependency management
- **Python 3.12** with automatic environment management
- **Lock files** for reproducible builds across all environments

**Code Quality:**
- **Ruff** - Lightning-fast linting and formatting (replaces Black, isort, Flake8)
- **MyPy** - Static type checking for Python
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automated quality checks before every commit

**Development Experience:**
- **VS Code Dev Containers** - Consistent development environment with Docker
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automated testing on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Pytest** with async support and coverage reporting
- **GitHub Copilot ready** configuration

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Complete agentic Python environment setup (paste entire block)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh && \
source $HOME/.cargo/env && \
uv init --python 3.12 . && \
uv add --dev pytest pytest-cov pytest-xdist ruff mypy pre-commit && \
uv sync && uv run pre-commit install
```

**Key Commands:**
```bash
uv sync                    # Install/update dependencies
uv run pytest            # Run tests with coverage
uv run ruff check .       # Lint code
uv run ruff format .      # Format code
uv run mypy src/          # Type check
uv run pre-commit run --all-files  # Run all quality checks
```

### 1Password Integration
Long-term authentication without repeated signins:

```bash
./bin/setup-1password-service.sh
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Works for weeks/months automatically
- âœ… Works across all OOS installations
- âœ… Integrated with `/start-coding`

### Archon Project Management
Task tracking and project coordination:

```bash
./bin/setup-archon.sh --setup
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Task tracking and management
- âœ… Project status visibility
- âœ… Knowledge base search
- âœ… Integrated with `/start-coding`

Both tools are automatically detected and configured when you run `/start-coding`.
