## 🎯 What is OOS?

OOS is your **intelligent middleware layer** that transforms Claude Code into a context-aware, token-optimized, self-documenting development environment. It "saves you from yourself" by automatically handling the complex stuff so you can focus on building.

### The Problem OOS Solves

- **Token waste**: Conversations hit limits with redundant context
- **Unclear requests**: You ramble, Claude asks confusing questions
- **Context loss**: Important information gets buried or forgotten
- **Repetitive work**: Same clarifications and optimizations over and over
- **Documentation debt**: Code changes without proper documentation

### The OOS Solution

- **Meta-clarification**: Get help from other AIs when Claude's questions are confusing
- **Auto-optimization**: Reduce token usage by 40-60% automatically
- **Smart workflows**: Turn rambling thoughts into structured plans
- **Self-documentation**: Automated commit messages and consistency checks
- **Learning system**: Remember lessons learned to avoid repeating mistakes

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 Context Engineering
- **Write/Select/Compress/Isolate** principles applied automatically
- **Filesystem offloading** for large context management
- **Intelligent caching** with relevance scoring
- **Multi-strategy compression** for optimal token usage

### 🤖 Meta-Clarification System
```
Claude: "I need clarification on your authentication requirements..."
You: /meta-ai
→ Get a structured prompt for ChatGPT/Claude to get better answers
```

## 🎯 Real-World Usage

### Example: Building a Chat App
```bash
You: /brain-dump I want to build a real-time chat app but not sure about WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events vs polling, also need authentication and maybe Docker but Kubernetes might be overkill

OOS: 🧠 Processing your request with context engineering...
     📊 Context optimized: 1,847 → 1,204 tokens (35% reduction)

     ✅ I'll help you implement this with:
     • Architecture planning for real-time communication
     • Authentication strategy selection
     • Deployment approach recommendations

     🚀 Let me break this down with clarifying questions...
```

### Example: Meta-Clarification
```bash
Claude: "I need more details about your database schema requirements, performance expectations, and data consistency needs..."

You: /meta-ai

OOS: Here's a structured prompt for external AI assistance:

===COPY THIS TO CHATGPT/CLAUDE===
I'm designing a database schema and need help with these technical decisions:

Context: Building a real-time chat application with user authentication

Questions:
1. Schema design: Normalized vs denormalized for chat messages?
2. Performance: Read replicas, indexing strategy, query optimization?
3. Consistency: ACID vs eventual consistency for real-time features?

Please provide specific recommendations with trade-offs for a mid-scale application.
=============================

## 🛠️ Development

### Learning Integration
OOS includes a self-referential learning system:

```bash
# Before developing, learn from past lessons
./bin/development_guide.sh

# Track new lessons in Archon
./bin/archon_learning.sh
```

This prevents repeating architecture mistakes, testing issues, and UX decisions.

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Automatic setup with oos-doctor
./bin/oos-doctor setup

# Manual setup
cp .githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## 🔒 Security & Safety Features

**OOS is built with security and user data protection as core principles:**

### Bulletproof API Key Protection
- **Pre-commit hooks** automatically scan every commit for API keys
- **Blocks dangerous patterns**: OpenAI, GitHub, Google, AWS, and generic long keys
- **Allows safe placeholders**: `your_api_key_here`, `sk-test-example`, etc.
- **Works everywhere**: OOS projects and all created projects get automatic protection

### Safe File Operations  
- **Never overwrites existing files** without explicit `--force` flag
- **Clear user warnings** with guidance on how to proceed
- **Automatic backups** when overwriting with `--force`
- **Edge case handling**: symlinks, directories, permission errors

### Monitoring & Validation
- **Self-contained logging** with sanitized sensitive data
- **Comprehensive testing** with 10+ scenarios covering all edge cases
- **Product launch methodology** ensuring reliability and user safety

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Safe by default - preserves existing files
./scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh my-project

# Output: [WARN] Skipping existing file: docs/CLAUDE.md
#         [WARN]   → Use --force to overwrite (automatic backup will be created)

# Explicit overwrite with backup
./scripts/bootstrap_enhanced.sh --force my-project

# API key protection in action
git commit -m "add config"
# Output: 🚨 COMMIT BLOCKED - API keys found in staged files!
#         File: config.js:10
#         Key: sk-proj-abc123... [REDACTED]
```

## 🌐 LLM Gateway (Bifrost) + Z.AI Overflow

**Seamlessly switch between Anthropic Pro and cost-effective Z.AI GLM-4.5 while preserving your existing Claude Code + MCP setup.**

**Quick Navigation:**
- [How to Use (Day-to-Day)](#how-to-use-day-to-day)
- [One-Time Setup](#one-time-setup)
- [MCP (Archon + Others)](#mcp-archon--others)
- [Gateway Management](#gateway-management)
- [Keys & Safety](#keys--safety)
- [Z.AI Integration Status](#zai-integration-status)

### How to Use (Day-to-Day)

**🎯 Best UX (Recommended):** Start every session through Bifrost on Anthropic → switch to Z.AI in-session when you hit Pro limits.

```bash
# 1. Start gateway once (on your OCI VM)
bash scripts/llm_gateway_up.sh

# 2. Start Claude Code on Anthropic (via gateway)
source scripts/cc-launchers.sh
cc-sona

# 3. Work as usual. When you hit limits, don't restart—just:
/model zai/glm-4.5

# You can always switch back: /model anthropic/claude-4-sonnet
# Model switching mid-session is fully supported
```

**Alternative:** Start direct Pro, switch to gateway when needed:
```bash
cc-pro                    # Start direct Pro
# When you hit limits, exit and run:
cc-sona                   # Switch to gateway mode  
claude -c                 # Resume your last conversation
# Or resume specific session: claude -r "<session-id>"
```

### One-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Start the gateway
bash scripts/llm_gateway_up.sh

# 2. Open Bifrost UI → add providers
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8080
# Go to Providers → Add:
#   • Anthropic: paste your console API key
#   • Z.AI: paste your GLM Coding Plan API key

# 3. Load launcher functions (add to your shell profile for persistence)
source scripts/cc-launchers.sh
```

### Usage Options

**Direct Anthropic Pro (unchanged):**
```bash
cc-pro              # Use normal Claude Code with Pro/Max
# Inside Claude Code: /login once, then use /model claude-4-sonnet
```

**Via Gateway (switchable models):**
```bash
cc-sona             # Start on Anthropic Sonnet via gateway
# Inside Claude Code: /status shows base URL .../anthropic
# Switch models: /model zai/glm-4.5
# Switch back: /model anthropic/claude-4-sonnet

# Or launch directly on Z.AI
cc-zai              # Start directly on Z.AI GLM-4.5
```

### MCP (Archon + Others)

**Once you've added your MCP servers, they work the same in both modes (direct or gateway):**

```bash
# Add once, reuse everywhere
claude mcp add-json archon '{"type":"sse","url":"https://archon.example.com:8051/mcp"}'
claude mcp get archon

# Works in both cc-pro and cc-sona/cc-zai sessions
# Claude Code supports MCP; add once, reuse everywhere
```

### Gateway Management

```bash
# Start gateway
bash scripts/llm_gateway_up.sh

# Stop gateway  
bash scripts/llm_gateway_down.sh

# Check if running
docker ps | grep oos-bifrost
```

### OCI Security Notes

- **Default**: Gateway binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` (localhost only)
- **For remote access**: SSH tunneling recommended
- **If you must expose**: Add NSG ingress rule for TCP/8080 and open host firewall

### Keys & Safety

**Keep keys out of git.** Put API keys into Bifrost UI or a local `.env` that's already ignored by OOS:

```bash
# LLM Gateway (optional; store keys in Bifrost UI or local .env)
ZAI_API_KEY=your_zai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
# Optional future providers:
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
KIMI_API_KEY=
```

**Security:** Bifrost binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost-only). If you must expose it on OCI, open an NSG ingress + host firewall, but localhost is safer.

### Z.AI Integration Status

**✅ READY FOR EXECUTION**

Complete demonstration project created in Archon (`ba97acbf-4a87-48b6-831f-5866fe9fb8d6`) with 6-phase execution plan:
